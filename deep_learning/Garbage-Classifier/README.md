**PROJECT TITLE**

# Garbage Classifier

**GOAL**

To develop a computer vision algorithm that can differentiate between different types of garbage materials which will help in automating the recycling process.

**DATASET**

The data set is taken from multiple sources, cropped compressed and organised to be used for this project this also includes creating some of my own dataset. 

**DESCRIPTION**

This project contains a custom CNN algorithm using tenserflow and keras to train a model on images of 7 different types of garbage materials including organic, metal, plastic, glass, cardboard, paper, plastic. It also includes empty background.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

I have collected, processed image datasets from different sources including creating my own image dataset of empty background.
Created the algorithm using keras and tenserflow in google collab and saved the model.
Used that model in another python program using open cv and the real time feed from the webcam is used to detect materials

**MODELS USED**
