BREAST CANCER PREDICTION

OBJECTIVE
The objective of the Breast Cancer Prediction Model is to accurately identify the likelihood of breast cancer occurrence in individuals by analyzing various risk factors and medical data. This model aims to aid in early detection, improve treatment planning, and ultimately reduce mortality rates associated with breast cancer.
