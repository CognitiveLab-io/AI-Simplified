# GOAL
The main purpose of this project is to understand which independent variables are actually useful to predict the price of the cars.

# DATASET
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction?select=CarPrice_Assignment.csv

# DESCRIPTION
Our aim is to find Which independent variables are significant in predicting the price of a car that is, how well those variables describe the price of a car. The Regression Models like Linear and Lasso Regression Models are used to describe the relation between the various variables and the price of the cars.

# WHAT I HAD DONE
The step by step procedure of how project works:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Encoding the Categorical data
- Splitting Data And Target
- Splitting Training and Test Data
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Visualization of Actual and Predicted Values

# MODELS USED

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression

# LIBRARIES NEEDED
Libraries required:
- pandas
- matplotlib

# ACCURACIES
Linear Regression showed an R2 Squared error of *0.836* whereas Lasso Regression showed an R2 Squared Error Score of *0.87*.

# CONCLUSION
The best accuracy was showed by Lasso Regression. Hence, we chose Lasso Regression as our Model.
