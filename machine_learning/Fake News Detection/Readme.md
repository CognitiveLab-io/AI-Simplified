**PROJECT TITLE**

FAKE NEWS DETECTION

**GOAL**

The main goal of this project is to determine whether the news generated is fake or not.

**DATASET**

The Dataset has been taken from some helping group.
The drive link to the dataset is : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YUn2zrrYJvVCOrrCaHxBENrYIxUibraZ?usp=sharing

**DESCRIPTION**

The project involved the feature processsing, conversion of text data to numerical data using a encoding technique.
Then, the data is trained up on machine learning algorithms RandomForestClassfier, Logistic Regression.We can also use
different classification models to classify whether it's a fake news or not.

This classification problem has input features like author,title,text and label.
After performing feature engineering, we are ended up with necessary features i.e text and label

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

Steps involved in this project:
1.Data Cleaning
2.Data Processing
3.Text Encoding
4.Data Modelling
5.Data Prediction
6.Data Evaluation

**MODELS USED**

I have used:
1. RandomForestClassifier
2. LogisticRegression

We can also try with some other classification models and tuning the hyperparameters accordingly.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

Libraries I used:
1.Pandas
2.Numpy
3.Sklearn
4.Re
5.String

**VISUALIZATION**

There is no numeric Data to visualize the patterns

**ACCURACIES**

RandomForestClassifier : 
1. Training Data: 99.99%
2. Testing Data : 99.04%

Logistic Regression:
1. Training Data: 99.14%
2. Testing Data : 98.75%



**CONCLUSION**
Among the Models I used for classifying the news, RandomForestClassifier performed well.
