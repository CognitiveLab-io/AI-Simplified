### Melboure house price predictor 

## GOAL

The main purpose of this Project is to increase the accuracy and to have the most accurate model to predict Melbone house price among all the machine learning models.

## DATASET

Data has been used from Kaggle.
You can also refer to other dataset inluding the required attributes.

## DESCRIPTION

The project involved analysis of the Melboure house price dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models will be trained and predictions will be made with different algorithms Linear Regression,Navie Bayes,Desion Tree Classifier ,Random Forest Regressor, K Neighbour Classification. Variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of price. This is a regrassion problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a conntinuous variable, predicting the price of house.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

The step by step procedure of how project works:

i. inporting libraries

ii. importing file

iii. Understand our dataset

iv. define x and y

v. train and test split

vi. Model fitting

vii. ML Model comperesion
