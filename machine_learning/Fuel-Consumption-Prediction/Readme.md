# Fuel Comsumption Prediction

## GOAL

The main purpose of this Project is to predict the fuel consumption of a car based on certain parameters and help users decide on which car will be a more economical choice.

## DATASET

This dataset has been taken from Kaggle.<br>

## DESCRIPTION

The project involved analysis of fuel consumption dataset with proper data processing. Then, 2 different models are trained and predictions will be made with different algorithms Linear Regression and Decision Tree. Variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the fuel consumed in miles per gallon of a car. This is a regression problem, with input features as a variety of parameters found in a car, and the target variable as a numerical data, predicting how much fuel is consumed.

## WHAT I HAVE DONE
