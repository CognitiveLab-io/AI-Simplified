PROJECT TITLE

Credit Card Fraud Detection

GOAL

The main purpose of the project is to improve the accuracy score of Support Vector Machine Classifier(SVM) by balancing the dataset with the help of SMOTE(Oversampling) technique.

DESCRIPTION

The credit card fraud detection model aims to identify fraudulent transactions using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification.SMOTE is applied to create synthetic samples of fraudulent transactions, effectively increasing the representation of the minority class in the dataset.The model learns the patterns and characteristics that distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

WHAT I HAD DONE

1.Data Cleaning
2.Data Visualization
3.Oversampling
4.Data Processing
5.Standardization of data
6.Data Modeling
7.Data Prediction
8.Data Evaluation

MODELS USED

Algorithm used:
1.Support Vector Machine
2.Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE)

LIBRARIES NEEDED

1.Pandas
2.Numpy
3.Seaborn
4.Matplotlib
5.Sklearn
6.Imblearn

VISUALIZATION

Visualization of the dataset is done by using Pie-plot,Count plot,heat map and also with hyperplane.Output Images are stored in Images Folder.

ACCURACIES

SVM Classifiaction:

Recall score: 0.9184
Precision score: 0.0520
F1-Score: 0.0985
Accuracy score: 0.9711
AUC: 0.9448


CONCLUSION
So by using the SMOTE(Oversampling) Technique , we can increase the accuracy score of the model by SVM classification.
