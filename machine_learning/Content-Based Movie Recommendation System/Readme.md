### Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

## GOAL

The main purpose of this Project is to recommend a Movie by using Machine Learning Model and deploying of Model In website
## DATASET

Data has been used from Kaggle.
You can also refer to other dataset inluding the required attributes.
Reference to more data set - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

## DESCRIPTION

The project will tell how you can  a movie by using Content based Filtering.So,A Movie can be recommend in many  ways of filtering but Content-Based Filtering 
is simple and  easy to understand type of Movie recommendation,which use genre or keywords like title,year,Cast,director,etc and make a Machine learning model by the similarities of these.Also we will deploy the model in webiste by using Streamlit

## Steps to do:-
 
 - DATA COLLECTION
 - DATA CLEANING
 - DATA PREPARING
 - CHOOSING A MODEL
 - PREPARING A MODEL
 - DEPLOY IN WEBSITE
 
## MODEL USED
For Content-Base Filtering Recommend System we use Similarity Model in which we have many different Mathematical Functions to find similarity between two 
Vectors of a movie and after Comparing them Model recommend a movie. And In model we have particularly use cosine similarity which is really easy and helpful model
available in Sckit-learn

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

Libraries required:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sckit-learn
* Streamlit(Website)
* Pickle
* AST



## ACCURACIES

Accuracies and results of Algorithms used
WHEN USER HAS RATED LESS THAN 18 MOVIES
RMSE:= 1.0584
MSE:-0.8213

## CONCLUSION
Beginner friendly and  easy recommendation  system for movies which is easy to understand
