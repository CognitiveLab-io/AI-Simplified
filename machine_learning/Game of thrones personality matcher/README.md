# Game-Of-Thrones-Personality-Matcher ⚔️

## To create a Game of Thrones personality matcher app on Streamlit, you'll need to follow these steps:

Collect the data: First, you'll need to gather data about the characters in Game of Thrones, including their personality traits, motivations, and actions throughout the series. You can use online resources like the Game of Thrones Wiki to collect this data.

Define the matching algorithm: Next, you'll need to define the algorithm that will match users with a Game of Thrones character based on their personality traits. This could be a simple algorithm that compares the user's answers to a set of predefined questions with the known personality traits of the characters in the dataset.

Build the Streamlit app: Using the Streamlit framework, you can build a simple web app that allows users to answer questions about their personality and preferences. The app can then use the matching algorithm to suggest a Game of Thrones character that best matches the user's responses.

Add visual elements: To make your app more engaging and appealing to users, you can add visual elements like images of the characters that show how the user's responses compare to those of the different characters.
