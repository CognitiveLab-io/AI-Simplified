# LOAN STATUS Prediction

**GOAL**

The main purpose of this Project is to increase the accuracy and to have the most accurate model to predict loan status among all the machine learning models.

**DATASET**

Data has been used from Kaggle.

**DESCRIPTION**

The project involved analysis of the loan prediction dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models will be trained and predictions will be made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression etc. Variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict whether loan will be approved to a person or not. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting loan status approval.
