### Early Heart Disease Prediction
# ML Project

## Description
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models will be trained and predictions will be made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc. Variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

## Models Included:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* XGBoost

## Dataset
